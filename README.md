# Todo List with JavaScript

I usually don't progran with JavaScript but I wanted to try it and this was my first project with this language.
As the name implies, is just a simple Todo List but with no persistence.
I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf3CEsEwMQ&t=3395s) on Youtube and the result was [this](https://alexandre-beleza-rodrigues.github.io/todo-list/).
